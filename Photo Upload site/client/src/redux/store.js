//createSlice: This function comes from the @reduxjs/toolkit package.
//Itâ€™s a convenient way to create a Redux slice, which defines a piece of your application state along with its associated reducers.
// A slice typically includes actions and reducers for a specific part of your app.

//configureStore: Another gem from the Redux Toolkit! This function helps you configure your Redux store.//
// It combines your slices (created using createSlice) and sets up middleware, such as Thunk or Saga, if needed.
// The store is where your entire application state lives.
